# Job Browser BFF

This is a KBase dynamic service module dedicated to providing a JSONRPC 2.0 service for accessing jobs via the KBase Job browser. It is a "Back End for Front End" (BFF) service, meaning that it is dedicated to serving a specific front end web app, in this case the [Job Browser](https://github.com/kbase/kbase-ui-plugin-job-browser2).

## Usage

This service is designed to be used within the KBase system, and run by the KBase Service Wizard, a service which, in coordination with the KBase App Catalog and other services.

It can also be run stand-alone for ease of local development. (There is no other benefit to running it locally.) See the [documentation](docs/index.md) for such usage.
